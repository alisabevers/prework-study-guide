# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide is meant to prepare me for the Coding Bootcamp. This study guide includes notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I jotted notes on what I had the hardest time remembering, while working through the Prework Modules.

To use this Prework Study Guide, the user should simply review the notes listed beneath whichever section preferred. Users can also open the Chrome DevTools and see the Console panel, which will list all of the topics available for review. The Console panel will also suggest, at random, one of the topics to study first.
