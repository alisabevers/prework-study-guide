        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want on the <b>outside</b> of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want on the <b>inside</b> of an element.</li>
          <li><b>Inline CSS:</b> is coded directly within the HTML file. Each CSS attribute is applied to each HTML element. Less common since if there should be a style change, it would require you to go back and edit each element, individually.</li>
          <li><b>Internal style sheet:</b> CSS attributes are imbedded in the HTML file header. This allows for CSS rules to be applied generally to certain types of HTML elements.</li>
          <li><b>External style sheet:</b> CSS is coded in a separate file, then linked to the HTML file once completed. The CSS file is linked within the HTML header. This is the most commonly used type of CSS, since all of the styling is kept separate, making it easier to change when necessary.</li>

          <li>JS uses conditional logic. This can be coded by using <i>if/else statements.</i> The if block code will run only if the condition is met.</li>
          <li>Loops are used to iterate an object.</li>
          <li>Functions are sets of instructions to tell the computer to do a task. Functions are written, but then need to be called in order to run.</li>
